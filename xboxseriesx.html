            <p>The fourth generation of Xbox models, simply named Xbox, includes the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S
                that launched on November 10, 2020. Both are considered members of the ninth generation of video game
                consoles alongside the PlayStation 5, also released that month.

                <br /><br />

                The Xbox Series X and Series S are high- and low-end versions comparable to the Xbox One X and Xbox One
                S models, respectively, with all games designed for this model family playable on both systems. The Xbox
                Series X is estimated to be four times as powerful as Xbox One X, with support for 8K resolution and up
                to 120 frames-per-second rendering, with a nominal target of 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. The
                Xbox Series S is a digital-only unit with less graphic processing power, but can still render at a
                nominal 1440p resolution at 60 frames per second with support for 4K upscaling. Both consoles features
                support for new graphics rendering systems including real-time ray-tracing, and the new Xbox Velocity
                Architecture that works with the internal SSD drive to maximize the rate of texture streaming to the
                graphics processor, among other features. Besides games for this new console family, both consoles are
                fully compatible with all Xbox One games and most hardware, as well as all backward compatible games
                that were playable on the Xbox One from the Xbox 360 and original Xbox console.

                To help transition consumers, Microsoft introduced its Smart Delivery system which most of its
                first-party games and several third-party games will use to offer free updates to Xbox One versions of
                games to the Xbox Series X/S version over the first few years of the consoles' launch.

            <p>An all digital, cheaper alternative to the Xbox Series X was also released on November 10, 2020. The Xbox Series S includes almost all of the same features as the Xbox Series X, with the most noticeable differences being the lack of a disc drive and much smaller Robot White design.

                The console was announced almost nine months after the Xbox Series X was announced, with the console being marketed as "Next-gen performance in the smallest Xbox ever". The affordable price tag also helped the console make up for the the highest percentage of new players for any Xbox console at launch.
                
                Prior to the original announcement of the console, the specifications of the console were leaked online with the console being said to support; DirectX Ray Tracing, Variable Rate Shading and Variable Refresh Rates. During the official unveiling of the Xbox Series S, it was also announced that the console would output video at 1440p at 60 FPS with some games also supporting up to 120 FPS like the Series X.
