            <p>The Xbox (retroactively known now as the Original Xbox) was the first video game console by Microsoft,
                and the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles. It was released on November 15, 2001 in North
                America; February 22, 2002 in Japan; and in March 14, 2002 in Europe and Australia. It was the first
                major console produced by an American company since the release of the Atari Jaguar in 1993.The original
                Xbox was released on November 15, 2001, in North America, February 22, 2002, in Japan, and March 14,
                2002, in Australia and Europe. It was Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market. As part of
                the sixth generation of video game consoles, the Xbox competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's
                Dreamcast (which stopped American sales before the Xbox went on sale), and Nintendo's GameCube. The Xbox
                was the first console offered by an American company after the Atari Jaguar stopped sales in 1996. The
                name Xbox was derived from a contraction of DirectX Box, a reference to Microsoft's graphics API,
                DirectX.

                The integrated Xbox Live service launched in November 2002 allowed players to play games online with a
                broadband connection. It first competed with Dreamcast's online service but later primarily competed
                with PlayStation 2's online service. Although the two competing services were free, while Xbox Live
                required a subscription - as well as broadband-only connection, which was not completely adopted yet -
                Xbox Live was a success due to it having better servers, features such as a buddy list, and milestone
                titles such as Halo 2 (released in November 2004), which became the best-selling Xbox video game and was
                by far the most popular online game for the original Xbox system.
