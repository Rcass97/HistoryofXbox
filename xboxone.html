            <p>The Xbox One was released on November 22, 2013, in North America, as the successor to the Xbox 360. The
                Xbox One competes with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch as part of the eighth
                generation of video game consoles.

                Announced on May 21, 2013, the Xbox One has an emphasis on internet-based features, including the
                ability to record and stream gameplay, and the ability to integrate with a set-top box to watch cable or
                satellite TV through the console with an enhanced guide interface and Kinect-based voice control.

                <br /><br />

                Following its unveiling, the Xbox One proved controversial for its original digital rights management
                and privacy practices; while Microsoft touted the ability for users to access their library of games
                (regardless of whether they were purchased physically or digitally) on any Xbox One console without
                needing their discs, and the ability to share their entire library with 10 designated "family" members,
                all games would have to be tied to the user's Xbox Live account and their Xbox One console, and the
                console would be required to connect to the Internet on a periodic basis (at least once every 24 hours)
                to synchronize the library, or else the console would be unable to play any games at all. After an
                overwhelmingly negative response from critics and consumers (who also showed concerns that the system
                could prevent or hinder the resale of used games), Microsoft announced that these restrictions would be
                dropped. Microsoft was also criticized for requiring the Xbox One to have its updated Kinect
                peripheral plugged in to function, which critics and privacy advocates believed could be used as a
                surveillance device. As a gesture toward showing a commitment to user privacy, Microsoft decided to
                allow the console to function without Kinect.

            <p>The Xbox One S was the second model of the Xbox One. It was released as a slimmer and less expensive
                model of the Xbox One. The console has been completely redesigned in a new robot white color. The Xbox
                One S is also capable of streaming video content in 4K UHD.

                The Xbox One X is the premium Xbox One model. The Xbox One X is capable of playing a selection of games
                at 4K UHD with other enchantments through the Xbox One X Enhanced program. At the time of its release,
                the Xbox One X was the worlds most powerful console and was 4.5 times more powerful than the original
                Xbox One.

            <p>On May 7, 2019 Microsoft released an all digital edition variant of the Xbox One S. The console is near
                identical to the regular Xbox One S but does not include a disc drive. The console was released as a
                slightly cheaper alternative to other models in the Xbox One line. The console was bundled with three
                games, those being, Forza Horizon 3, Minecraft and Sea of Thieves.
