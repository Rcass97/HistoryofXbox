            <p>The Xbox 360 was released as the successor of the original Xbox in November 2005, competing with Sony's
                PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. As of June
                2014, 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide. The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV
                on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic
                Entertainment Expo (E3). The console sold out completely upon release in all regions except in Japan.
                Several retail configurations of the core Xbox 360 model were offered over its lifetime, varying the
                amount of RAM and internal storage offered.

                <br /><br />

                The Xbox 360 showed an expanded Xbox Live service (which now included a limited "Free" tier called
                Silver), the ability to stream multimedia content from PCs, while later updates added the ability to
                purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video
                services, along with access to third-party content services through third-party media streaming
                applications. Microsoft also released Kinect, a motion control system for the Xbox 360 which uses an
                advanced sensor system.

            <p>Also known as the Xbox 360 S was a complete hardware revision of the Xbox 360 that was released in 2010.
                This newer model completely replaced other models available prior to its release, those being the Elite
                and Arcade. The S was much smaller and compared to past models and a lot quieter.

                The Xbox 360 S also included a port dedicated for use with the Kinect which was released several months
                after the launch of the Slim model.

            <p>The final model in the Xbox 360 family was the Xbox 360 E. It was announced and released in 2013, the same year that the Xbox One was released. The E model is once again slimmer than past models and takes most of its designs from the first Xbox One model.
